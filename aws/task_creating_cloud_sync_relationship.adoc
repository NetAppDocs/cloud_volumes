A Cloud Sync relationship enables you to sync data to or from the Cloud Volume.

.Before you begin
* You must already have a Cloud Sync data broker.

<<task_creating_cloud_sync_data_broker.adoc#,Creating a Cloud Sync data broker>>
* The data broker IP address must have been added to the export policy for both the source and the target volumes.
+ 
The export policy on the target volume must allow write access to the data broker.
+
