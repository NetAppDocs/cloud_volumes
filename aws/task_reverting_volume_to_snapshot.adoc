You can revert a volume to an earlier point in time from an existing snapshot. When you revert a volume, the content of the snapshot overwrites the existing volume configuration. Any changes that were made to the data in the volume after the snapshot was created are lost.
+
Note that clients do not need to remount the volume after the revert operation.

.Steps
. On the Snapshots page or in the Snapshots tab in Volume details, select the snapshot that you want to revert to, click *Available*, and then select *Revert volume to snapshot*.
. In the Revert snapshot dialog box, reenter the name of the volume that you want to revert and click *Revert*.
