Cloud Volumes Service is available in many AWS regions. You must specify the region where you want to use the service before you create a cloud volume.

.Steps

. Navigate to the https://cds-aws-bundles.netapp.com/storage/volumes[NetApp Cloud Orchestrator^] site, and then log in with the email address that you provided during your subscription.
+
You should bookmark this URL. You will need to return to it later.
. From the *Available regions* drop-down menu in the top panel, select the region that you want to work in.
+
This selection process is similar to how you change regions in the AWS console.

. Repeat the above step for each additional region when you want to create a cloud volume.

*Note:* The regions displayed in the Cloud Volumes user interface may use a different format than the region you selected in the AWS user interface. For example _us-east-1_ in the Cloud Volumes UI corresponds to the _N.Virginia_ region selected in the AWS console. See https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Concepts.RegionsAndAvailabilityZones.html[Regions and Availability Zones] for a mapping of the region names to make sure you select the same region in both interfaces.
