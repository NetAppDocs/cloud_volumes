The Cloud Volumes capabilities that are available through the web UI are also available through RESTful APIs. The APIs enable you to create and manage cloud volumes and develop provisioning scripts and tools.

== Finding the API URL, API key, and Secret key
[[finding_urL_key_secretKey]]
You need to obtain the Cloud Volumes API URL, API key, and Secret key for running an API call.

.Steps
. Click **API access** on the storage page or in the drop-down menu under your username.
+
. Record the Cloud Volumes API URL, API key, and Secret key.

link:media/test.conf[Sample file showing the API URL, API key, and Secret key for an account]

== Listing the available APIs
The storage page displays the available APIs that you can use.

.Steps
. Click **API documentation** on the storage page.
+
The page lists the available APIs.
. Scroll through the page to see the available APIs.
+
The APIs are listed by function, for example:
+
* `filesystems`
* `mounttargets`
* `storage`
* `snapshots`
+
. To obtain details and examples of how to use an API call, select the function and click one of the following actions:
+
* `GET`: reads
* `POST`: creates
* `PUT`: updates or modifies
* `DELETE`: destroys

== Using the Cloud Volumes APIs
This section shows you how to use the Cloud Volumes APIs.  The examples use curl from a Linux bash shell. You need to replace `<api_url>`, `<api_key>`, and `<secret_key>` with the values you recorded from <<finding_urL_key_secretKey, Finding the API URL, API key, and Secret key>>.

=== Syntax
`*curl -s -H  accept:application/json  -H "Content-type: application/json" -H api-key:<api_key> -H secret-key:<secret_key> -X [GET,POST,PUT,DELETE] <api_url>/v1/<command>*`

=== Examples
==== Listing volumes
The following example displays information about all volumes:

NOTE: Piping the command through `jq` improves the formatting of the `json` output. You might need to install `jq` on your system.

[source,json]
curl -s -H accept:application/json -H "Content-type: application/json" -H api-key:<api_key> -H secret-key:<secret_key> -X GET <api_url>/v1/FileSystems | jq
[
{
	"created": "2018-07-05T18:58:23.000Z",
	"fileSystemId": "07c9ab6c-b655-a9fe-f904-b9b97ef9baaa",
	"lifeCycleState": "available",
	"lifeCycleStateDetails": "Available for use",
	"name": "SMB",
	"ownerId": "d38839c3-a37f-4426-9ef9-ae7569e59f1d",
	"region": "us-west-1",
	"creationToken": "prickly-bellicose-archimedes",
	"quotaInBytes": 1000000000000,
	"serviceLevel": "standard",
	"snapReserve": 0,
	"timezone": "PT",
	"usedBytes": 0
}
]

==== Listing the details for a specific volume
Each volume has an ID called `fileSystemId`, for example, `07c9ab6c-b655-a9fe-f904-b9b97ef9baaa`. Including the ID in the API call provides details for the specific volume:

[source,json]
curl -s -H accept:application/json -H "Content-type: application/json" -H api-key:<api_key> -H secret-key:<secret_key> -X GET <api_url>/v1/FileSystems/07c9ab6c-b655-a9fe-f904-b9b97ef9baaa

To see the network details for the volume, you can add `MountTargets` to the `GET` call:

[source,json]
curl -s -H accept:application/json -H "Content-type: application/json" -H api-key:<api_key> -H secret-key:<secret_key> -X GET <api_url>/v1/FileSystems/07c9ab6c-b655-a9fe-f904-b9b97ef9baaa/MountTargets

link:media/info-cv.py[Script to display the details of a cloud volume by mountpoint]

==== Creating a volume
The following example uses a `POST` call to create a volume called `Test`, in region `us-west-1`, with an `allocated capacity` of 100 GB and exported using `nfsv3`:

[source,json]
curl -s -H accept:application/json -H "Content-type: application/json" -H api-key:<api_key> -H secret-key:<secret_key> -X POST <api_url>/v1/FileSystems -d '
{
	"name": "Test",
	"creationToken": "grahams-test-volume3",
	"region": "us-west-1",
	"serviceLevel": "standard",
	"quotaInBytes": 100000000000,
	"exportPolicy": {"rules": [{"ruleIndex": 1,"allowedClients": "0.0.0.0/0","unixReadOnly": false,"unixReadWrite": true,"cifs": false,"nfsv3": true,"nfsv4": false}]},
	"labels": ["test"]
}'

link:media/create-cv.py[Script to create a cloud volume]

==== Updating a volume
The following example uses a `PUT` call to update a volume called `Test`, change the service level to `extreme`, and change the allocated capacity to 500 GB:

[source,json]
curl -s -H accept:application/json -H "Content-type: application/json" -H api-key:<api_key> -H secret-key:<secret_key> -X PUT <api_url>/v1/FileSystems/cdef5090-aa5e-c2cf-6bba-f77d259a37f8 -d '
{
	"creationToken": "grahams-test-volume4",
	"region": "us-west-1",
	"serviceLevel": "extreme",
	"quotaInBytes": 500000000000
}'

link:media/update-cv.py[Script to update a cloud volume]

==== Deleting a volume
The following example uses a `DELETE` call to delete a volume specified by `fileSystemId`:

[source,json]
curl -s -H accept:application/json -H "Content-type: application/json" -H api-key:<api_key> -H secret-key:<secret_key> -X DELETE <api_url>/v1/FileSystems/08b0578d-465f-6c1a-bf8c-f40098b6451b

link:media/delete-cv.py[Script to delete a cloud volume by mountpoint]

IMPORTANT: Use with caution. This API call deletes the volume and all its data.

==== Creating a snapshot
The following example uses a `POST` call to create a snapshot called `snappy` for a specific volume:

[source,json]
curl -s -H accept:application/json -H "Content-type: application/json" -H api-key:<api_key> -H secret-key:<secret_key> -X POST <api_url>/v1/FileSystems/07c9ab6c-b655-a9fe-f904-b9b97ef9baaa/Snapshots -d '
{
	"name": "snappy",
	"region": "us-west-1"
}'

link:media/snap-cv.py[Script to create snapshots of a cloud volume by mountpoint]

==== Creating a snapshot policy
The following example uses a `PUT` call to create snapshot policies for a specific volume:

[source,json]
curl -s -H accept:application/json -H "Content-type: application/json" -H api-key:<api_key> -H secret-key:<secret_key> -X PUT <api_url>/v1/FileSystems/07c9ab6c-b655-a9fe-f904-b9b97ef9baaa/ -d '
{
	"creationToken": "nfs1",
	"region": "us-west-1",

        "enabled": True,
        "weeklySchedule": {
            "day": Monday,Thursday,Saturday,
            "hour": 12,
            "minute": 30,
            "snapshotsToKeep": 4
				},
        "monthlySchedule": {
            "daysOfMonth": 1,14,28,
            "hour": 00,
