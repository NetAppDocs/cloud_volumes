The Cloud Volume capabilities that are available through the web UI are also available through RESTful APIs. The APIs enable you to create and manage cloud volumes and develop provisioning scripts and tools.

== Finding the API URL, API key, and Secret key
[[finding_urL_key_secretKey]]
You need to obtain the Cloud Volumes API URL, API key, and Secret key for running an API call.

.Steps
. Click **API access** on the storage page or in the drop-down menu under your username.
+
. Record the Cloud Volumes API URL, API key, and Secret key.

link:media/test.conf[Sample file showing the API URL, API key, and Secret key for an account]

== Listing the available APIs
The storage page displays the available APIs that you can use.

.Steps
. Click **API documentation** on the storage page.
+
The page lists the available APIs.
. Scroll through the page to see the available APIs.
+
The APIs are listed by function, for example:
+
* `filesystems`
* `mounttargets`
* `storage`
* `snapshots`
+
. To obtain details and examples of how to use an API call, select the function and click one of the following actions:
+
* `GET`: reads
* `POST`: creates
* `PUT`: updates or modifies
* `DELETE`: destroys

== Using the Cloud Volume APIs
This section shows you how to use the Cloud Volume APIs.  The examples use curl from a Linux bash shell. You need to replace `<api_url>`, `<api_key>`, and `<secret_key>` with the values you recorded from <<finding_urL_key_secretKey, Finding the API URL, API key, and Secret key>>.

=== Syntax
`*curl -s -H  accept:application/json  -H "Content-type: application/json" -H api-key:<api_key> -H secret-key:<secret_key> -X [GET,POST,PUT,DELETE] <api_url>/v1/<command>*`

=== Examples
==== Listing volumes
The following example displays information about all volumes:

NOTE: Piping the command through `jq` improves the formatting of the `json` output. You might need to install `jq` on your system.

[source]
curl -s -H accept:application/json -H "Content-type: application/json" -H api-key:<api_key> -H secret-key:<secret_key> -X GET <api_url>/v1/FileSystems | jq

	"timezone": "PT",
	"usedBytes": 0
}
]

link:media/list-cv.sh[Script to list cloud volumes in an account]

==== Listing the details for a specific volume
Each volume has an ID called `fileSystemId`, for example, `07c9ab6c-b655-a9fe-f904-b9b97ef9baaa`. Including the ID in the API call provides details for the specific volume:

``
curl -s -H accept:application/json -H "Content-type: application/json" -H api-key:<api_key> -H secret-key:<secret_key> -X GET <api_url>/v1/FileSystems/07c9ab6c-b655-a9fe-f904-b9b97ef9baaa
``

To see the network details for the volume, you can add `MountTargets` to the `GET` call:

``
curl -s -H accept:application/json -H "Content-type: application/json" -H api-key:<api_key> -H secret-key:<secret_key> -X GET <api_url>/v1/FileSystems/07c9ab6c-b655-a9fe-f904-b9b97ef9baaa/MountTargets
``

link:media/info-cv.sh[Script to display the details of a cloud volume by mountpoint]

==== Creating a volume
The following example uses a `POST` call to create a volume called `Test`, in region `us-west`, with a `quota` of 100 GB and exported using `nfsv3`:

[source]
curl -s -H accept:application/json -H "Content-type: application/json" -H api-key:<api_key> -H secret-key:<secret_key> -X POST <api_url>/v1/FileSystems -d '
{
	"name": "Test",
	"creationToken": "grahams-test-volume3",
	"region": "us-west",
	"serviceLevel": "basic",
	"quotaInBytes": 100000000000,
	"exportPolicy": {"rules": [{"ruleIndex": 1,"allowedClients": "0.0.0.0/0","unixReadOnly": false,"unixReadWrite": true,"cifs": false,"nfsv3": true,"nfsv4": false}]},
	"labels": ["test"]
}'

link:media/create-cv.sh[Script to create a cloud volume]

==== Updating a volume
The following example uses a `PUT` call to update a volume called `Test`, change the service level to `extreme`, and change the quota to 500 GB:

[source]
curl -s -H accept:application/json -H "Content-type: application/json" -H api-key:<api_key> -H secret-key:<secret_key> -X PUT <api_url>/v1/FileSystems/cdef5090-aa5e-c2cf-6bba-f77d259a37f8 -d '
{
	"creationToken": "grahams-test-volume4",
	"region": "us-west",
	"serviceLevel": "extreme",
	"quotaInBytes": 500000000000
}'

link:media/update-cv.sh[Script to update a cloud volume]

==== Deleting a volume
The following example uses a `DELETE` call to delete a volume specified by `fileSystemId`:

``
curl -s -H accept:application/json -H "Content-type: application/json" -H api-key:<api_key> -H secret-key:<secret_key> -X DELETE <api_url>/v1/FileSystems/08b0578d-465f-6c1a-bf8c-f40098b6451b
``

link:media/delete-cv.sh[Script to delete a cloud volume by mountpoint]

IMPORTANT: Use with caution. This API call deletes the volume and all its data.

==== Creating a snapshot
The following example uses a `POST` call to create a snapshot called `snappy` for a specific volume:

[source]
curl -s -H accept:application/json -H "Content-type: application/json" -H api-key:<api_key> -H secret-key:<secret_key> -X POST <api_url>/v1/FileSystems/07c9ab6c-b655-a9fe-f904-b9b97ef9baaa/Snapshots -d '
{
	"name": "snappy",
	"region": "us-west"
}

link:media/snap-cv.sh[Script to create snapshots of a cloud volume by mountpoint]

==== Listing snapshots for a specific volume
The following example uses a `GET` call to list the snapshots for  a specific volume:

``
curl -s -H accept:application/json -H "Content-type: application/json" -H api-key:<api_key> -H secret-key:<secret_key> -X GET <api_url>/v1/FileSystems/07c9ab6c-b655-a9fe-f904-b9b97ef9baaa/Snapshots
``

link:media/get-snaps.sh[Script to list snapshots of a cloud volume by mountpoint]

==== Reverting a snapshot
The following example uses a `POST` call to revert a volume from a snapshot specified by `snapshotId` and `fileSystemId`:

[source]
curl -s -H accept:application/json -H "Content-type: application/json" -H api-key:<api_key> -H secret-key:<secret_key> -X POST <api_url>/v1/FileSystems/cdef5090-aa5e-c2cf-6bba-f77d259a37f8/Revert -d '
{
	"snapshotId": "e19c5b72-daee-aa22-159d-a24702907fad",
	"fileSystemId": "cdef5090-aa5e-c2cf-6bba-f77d259a37f8",
	"region": "us-west"
}'

link:media/revert-snap.sh[Script to revert to a snapshot of a cloud volume by mountpoint and snapshotId]

IMPORTANT: Use with caution.  This API call causes any data written after the snapshot to be lost.

==== Creating a new volume from a snapshot
The following example uses a `POST` call to create a new volume specified by `snapshotId`:

[source]
curl -s -H accept:application/json -H "Content-type: application/json" -H api-key:<api_key> -H secret-key:<secret_key> -X POST <api_url>/v1/FileSystems -d '
{
	"snapshotId": "e19c5b72-daee-aa22-159d-a24702907fad",
	"name": "Clone",
	"creationToken": "perfectly-cloned-volume",
	"region": "us-west",
	"serviceLevel": "extreme"
}'
