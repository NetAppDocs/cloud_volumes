Once you have access to Cloud Volumes Service shortly after subscribing in AWS marketplace, it is strongly recommended that you activate support entitlement. Activating support entitlement enables you to access technical support over online chat, web ticketing system, and phone.

The default support level is self-service until serial number activation and registration is completed.

== Activating support entitlement
During the initial subscription process with Cloud Volumes Service for AWS, your cloud volumes instance generates a 20-digit NetApp serial number that starts with "930". The NetApp serial number represents the Cloud Volumes Service subscription associated to your AWS account. You must register the NetApp serial number to activate support entitlement. We offer 2 options for support registration:

. Current NetApp customer with existing NetApp Support Site (NSS) SSO account
. New NetApp customer with no existing NetApp Support Site (NSS) SSO account

=== Option 1: Current NetApp customer with existing NetApp Support Site (NSS) SSO account

.Steps

. Navigate to the Cloud Volumes Service URL, or access this service through the https://cds-aws-bundles.netapp.com/storage/volumes[NetApp Cloud Central portal^]. Then login with your NetApp Cloud Central credentials.
. Display your NetApp serial number by selecting **Support** in the Cloud Volumes Service user interface (UI).

. In the **Support** page, verify that your Support status shows `Not registered`.

+
If you do not see the Support status and your NetApp serial number, refresh the browser page.
. Click **Activate support** to register your NetApp serial number:
+
** If you have an NSS account, enter your NSS credentials (username and password) in the **Activate support** page and click **Activate** to activate support entitlement for your NetApp serial number.
+

+
** If you are an existing NetApp customer, but you do not have NSS SSO credentials, go to the http://now.netapp.com/newuser/[NetApp Support Registration site] to create your account first. Then return here to register with your NSS credentials.
+
** If you are a new NetApp customer, see the instructions for Option 2 below.

After your NetApp serial number is activated, the **Support** page shows the status `Registered`, indicating that you have activated support entitlement.

This is a one-time support registration for the applicable Cloud Volumes Service serial number. Any new Cloud Volumes Service subscription and subsequent new serial number requires support activation as well. If you have any questions or problems with support registration, contact us at cvs-support@netapp.com.

=== Option 2: New NetApp customer with no existing NetApp Support Site (NSS) SSO account

. As a new NetApp customer, you also need to create a NetApp Support Site (NSS) user account for future support activations and for access to the support portal for technical support chat and web ticketing. Go to the http://now.netapp.com/newuser/[NetApp Support Registration site] to perform this task. You can provide your newly registered Cloud Volumes Service serial number to expedite the process.

This is a one-time support registration for the applicable Cloud Volumes Service serial number. Any new Cloud Volumes Service subscription and subsequent new serial number requires support activation as well. If you have any questions or problems with support registration, contact us at cvs-support@netapp.com.

== Obtaining support information

NetApp provides support for Cloud Volumes Service in a variety of ways. Extensive free self-support options are available 24x7, such as knowledgebase (KB) articles or the NetApp community. The Cloud Volumes Service subscription purchased from the AWS SaaS marketplace includes remote technical support via chat, email, web ticketing, or phone. You must first activate support for each NetApp serial number in order to use these non self-service support options. A NetApp Support Site (NSS) SSO account is required for chat and web ticketing along with case management.

You can access support options from the Cloud Volumes Service UI by selecting the **Support** tab from the main menu. The support options available to you depend on whether you are in Trial mode or Subscription mode.
