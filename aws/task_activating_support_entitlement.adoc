Before you create your first Cloud Volume, it is strongly recommended that you activate support entitlement.  Activating support entitlement enables you to access technical support over the online chat, the web ticketing system, and the phone.

== Activating support entitlement
During the initial subscription process with Cloud Volumes Service for AWS, the Cloud Volumes instance generates a 20-digit NetApp subscription ID that starts with "930". The NetApp subscription ID represents the Cloud Volumes Service that is tied to your AWS account. You register the NetApp subscription ID to activate support entitlement.  You need NetApp Support Site (NSS) credentials for the support activation process.

.Steps

. Navigate to the https://cds-aws-bundles.netapp.com/storage/volumes[NetApp Cloud Orchestrator^] site, and then log in with the email address that you provided during your subscription.
. Display your NetApp subscription ID by clicking **Support** in the Cloud Volumes Service user interface (UI).

.. If you are new to NetApp or do not have an existing NSS account, go to the  https://register.netapp.com[Cloud Data Services Support Registration^] page (register.netapp.com) to create a NetApp Support Site (NSS) account.
+
You will be prompted to provide your NetApp subscription ID and your AWS customer ID.
.. From the Cloud Volumes Service UI, click **Activate support** and enter your NSS credentials (username and password) to activate support entitlement for your NetApp subscription ID.

== Deactivating support

If you ever need to deactivate support for your subscription, click **Deactivate support** from the Support page, type `deactivate` as prompted, and click **Deactivate support** again to confirm.

NOTE: NetApp recommends that you do not deactivate support for your subscription unless you are certain that you no longer need the service.
If you mistakenly deactivated support, you can create a web ticket to reactivate the subscription.
