. Select *NFS*, *SMB*, or *Dual-protocol* in the Create Volume page, and provide information for the following fields:
* *Name*
+
Specify the name you want to use for the volume.
+
* *Region*
+
Select the AWS region where you want to create the volume.
+
* *Timezone*
+
Select your time zone.
+
* *Volume path*
+
Specify the path you want to use or accept the automatically generated path.
* *Create from snapshot* (Optional)
+
Select an existing snapshot to create a volume.
* *Service level*
+
Select *Standard*, *Premium*, or *Extreme*.
+
** _Standard_ provides 1000 IOPS per TB (16k IO) and 16 MB/s of throughput per TB.
** _Premium_ provides 4000 IOPS per TB (16k IO) and 64 MB/s of throughput per TB.
** _Extreme_ provides 8000 IOPS per TB (16k IO) and 128 MB/s of throughput per TB.

* *Allocated capacity*
+
Select the allocated capacity for the volume.
+

* *Security style*
+
If you selected Dual-protocol, you can change the security style by selecting *NTFS* or *UNIX* from the drop-down menu.
+
Security styles affect the file permission type used and how permissions can be modified.
+
** UNIX uses NFSv3 mode bits, and only NFS clients can modify permissions.
** NTFS uses NTFS ACLs, and only SMB clients can modify permissions.

* *Export policy*
+
If you selected NFS or Dual-protocol, you can create an export policy by providing information for the following fields:
+
** *Allowed clients*
+
Specify the allowed clients by using an IP address or Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR).
** *Access*
+
Select *Read & Write* or *Read only*.

** *Add export policy rule* (optional)
+
Click to add additional export policy rules.

* *Enable data encryption*
+
For SMB or Dual-protocol, you can enable SMB session encryption by checking this box.
+
*Note:* Do not enable encryption if SMB 2.1 clients need to mount the volume.

* *Active Directory*
+
For SMB or Dual-protocol, you can integrate the volume with a Windows Active Directory server by providing the following information:

** *DNS server*
+
Enter the IP address of the DNS server that you want to use.
** *Domain*
+
Enter the domain for the SMB share.
** *NetBIOS*
+
Enter a NetBIOS name for the SMB server that will be created.
** *Username*
+
Enter a username for your Active Directory server.
+
You can use any username that is authorized to create machine accounts in the Active Directory domain to which you are joining the SMB server.
** *Password*
+
Enter the password for the AD username that you specified in Username.
+

+
IMPORTANT: You should follow the guidance on AWS security group settings to enable cloud volumes to integrate with Windows Active Directory servers correctly.
<<reference_security_groups_windows_ad_servers.adoc#,AWS security group settings for Windows AD servers>>

* *Snapshot policy* (Optional)
+
** Select the snapshot frequency: *Hourly*, *Daily*, *Weekly*, or *Monthly*.
** Select the number of snapshots to keep.
** Select the time when the snapshot should be taken:
