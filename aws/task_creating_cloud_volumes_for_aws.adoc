IMPORTANT: You should follow the guidance on AWS security group settings to enable Cloud Volumes to integrate with Windows Active Directory servers correctly.

* *Security style*
+
If you selected Dual-protocol, you can change the security style by selecting *NTFS* or *UNIX* from the drop-down menu.
+
Security styles affect the file permission type used and how permissions can be modified.
+
** UNIX uses NFSv3 mode bits, and only NFS clients can modify permissions.
** NTFS uses NTFS ACLs, and only SMB clients can modify permissions.

* *Snapshot policy* (Optional)

***	Select *Hour* and *Minute* for daily snapshots.
***	Select *Weekday(s)*, *Hour*, and *Minutes* for weekly snapshots.
***	Select *Day(s)* of month, *Hour*, and *Minutes* for monthly snapshots.
